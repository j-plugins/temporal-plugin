Reports methods in classes or interfaces marked with <code>#[ActivityInterface]</code> that do not have the <code>#[ActivityMethod]</code> attribute.
<p>
    In Temporal PHP SDK, while not strictly required for all methods, it is recommended to explicitly mark activity methods with the <code>#[ActivityMethod]</code> attribute to ensure clarity and allow for custom activity naming.
